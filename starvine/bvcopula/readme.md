Copula
=================

StarVine includes a variety of bivariate copula models.

All copula rotations are implemented, allowing for easy modeling of negative
or positive dependence structures.

### Example Copula PDFs ###

The following copula are currently implemented in StarVine

- Elliptic
    + Gaussian
    + Student's T

- Archimedean
    + Frank (all rotations)
    + Gumbel (all rotations)
    + Clayton (all rotations)
